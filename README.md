shadowsocks-configfile
======================

[shadowsocks-gui](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-gui) does not support 0.0.0.0
but [shadowsocks-local](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-go) does, so this "script" did the job to convert previous gui version's config json to shadowsocks-local one.
